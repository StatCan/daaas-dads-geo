There are three four types of services (outputs) in GeoServer. Web Mapping Services (WMS) provide the map as an image; WMS can be used for both vector and raster data Web Feature Services (WFS) provide features with their geometry and attributes. GeoJSON is the most common formate of a WFS. However, it can support formats such as shapefiles and CSVs. WFS only support vector data Web Coverage Services (WCS) are similar to WFS but serve raster data. WCS provide tile services that take large raster data and divide them into tiles that only load in the geographic area in view. Tile services allow the data to be consumed more efficiently online. Web Processing Services (WPS) provide geoprocessing such as calculations and algorithms. They are essentially geoprocessing tools available online that can write to data locally or on a database. Unfortunately, WPS are not supported out-of-the-box in GeoServer and must be added with an extension. Note Only designated people have access to the internal workings of GeoServer. If you think you require access, please contact your DAaaS point person . Getting Started Log in/Sign on Once you are logged in, you will see the GeoServer homepage. The left-hand column contains a list of tools you will use to manage the server. The tools are grouped into related categories, such as the About & Status tool group that will give you information about the server. Orginization of Data The first tool in the Data group is the Layer Preview. The tool is not part of the hierarchy, but it will give you a list of all the layers available on your GeoServer. Workspaces Click the Workspaces tool from the Data group on the homepage. You will see the Workspaces dialogue. Click the green plus button at the top of the page to add a new Workspace. Give the Workspace a name. - The name should not contain blank spaces - The name can be anything unique - The name should clearly identify your Project - The Workspace will also require Namespace URI Stores Click Stores or you can first navigate back to the homepage by clicking the GeoServer icon in the top lefthand corner. Once you have navigated to the list of Stores, click the green plus button to add a new Store. Here you will see a list of all the different inputs that can be loaded on the server. Layers Next, you will add a Layer. Click Layers from the list of tools on the homepage. Click the green plus to add a new Layer. You will choose from which Store you want to add a Layer. Choose the PostGIS Store you just created. A list of Layers that are available in the Store will appear. Select publish next to the Layer. The Edit Layer dialog will appear. You can change the name if you want. You will need to ensure the Coordinate Reference System is correct. GeoServer will try and determine this automatically. You can double-check the coordinate system by loading the data into QGIS. Right-click the feature on the layers pane and navigate to Source. You will next compute the bounding boxes by clicking Compute from data and Compute from native bounds. Click Save. You will see your new feature in the Layers list. Back on the list of tools, choose the Layer Preview option. You should see the Layer you just created. Click the OpenLayers link in the Common Formats column. A new tab will appear with an OpenLayers map of your data. The data will be symbolized in the default symbology. Layer Group Text Symbolizing your Data GeoServer stores symbology and labels in XML documents called Styles . You can create your customized Style in QGIS by symbolizing and labeling your data and storing the symbology as a Style Layer Definition file (SDL) . Note You can apply the same Styles file to multiple Layers on the server. Creating a Style SLD in QGIS To do this, load your data into QGIS: Right-click the feature in the Layers pane and select Layer Properties.

Getting Started in AAW Using Jupyter Notebooks in AAW allows users to connect to the ArcGIS Enterprise Portal using various python APIs. See Getting Started in AAW and the use of Jupyter Notebooks within the space. Connecting to ArcGIS Enterprise Portal using ArcGIS API Logging into the Portal Once the Jupyter Notebook is set up in the AAW environment, follow the code example below to get familiar with basic commands to access content on the ArcGIS Enterprise Portal. Begin by pasting conda install -c esri arcgis into the Notebook and click run. This will allow you to easily install libraries into your Python environment. Import the necessary libraries that you will need in the Notebook. from arcgis.gis import GIS from arcgis.gis import Item from IPython.display import display Your project group will be provided with a Client ID upon onboarding which will be used to connect to the ArcGIS Enterprise Portal. Paste the Client ID inbetween the quoatations client_id=' ' . gis = GIS ( \"https://geoanalyticsdev.cloud.statcan.ca/portal\" , client_id = ' ' ) print ( \"Successfully logged in as: \" + gis . properties . user . username ) The output will redirect you to a web page where you can login to the Portal using the StatCan Azure Login option. After successful login, you will recive a code to sign in using SAML. Paste this code into the output. Display user information Using the 'me' function, we can display various information about the user logged in.\\ me = gis . users . me username = me . username description = me . description display ( me ) Search for Content Search for the content you have hosted on the DAaaS Geo Portal. Using the 'me' function we can search for all of the hosted content on the account. There are multiple ways to search for content. Two different methods are outlined below. Search all of your hosted itmes in the DAaaS Geo Portal. my_content = me . items () my_content Search for specific content you own in the DAaaS Geo Portal. This is similar to the example above, however if you know the title of they layer you want to use, you can save it as a function. my_items = me . items () for items in my_items : print ( items . title , \" | \" , items . type ) if items . title == \"Flood in Sorel-Tracy\" : flood_item = items else : continue print ( flood_item ) Search all content you have access to, not just your own. flood_item = gis . content . search ( \"tags: flood\" , item_type = \"Feature Service\" ) flood_item Get Content to Use in the Jupyter Notebook We need to get the item from the DAaaS Geo Portal in order to use it in the Jupyter Notebook. This is done by providing the unique identification number of the item you want to use. Three examples are outlined below, all accessing the identical layer. item1 = gis . content . get ( my_content [ 5 ] . id ) #from searching your content above display ( item1 ) item2 = gis . content . get ( flood_item . id ) #from example above -searching for specific content display ( item2 ) item3 = gis . content . get ( 'edebfe03764b497f90cda5f0bfe727e2' ) #the actual content id number display ( item3 ) Perform Analysis Once the layers are brought into the Jupyter notebook, we are able to perform similar types of analyis you would expect to find in a GIS software such as ArcGIS. There are many modules containing many submodels of which can perfrom multiple types of analyses. Using the arcgis.features module, import the use_proximity submodule from arcgis.features import use_proximity . This submodule allows us to '.create_buffers' - areas of equal distance from features. Here, we specify the layer we want to use, distance, units, and ouput name (you may also specify other chracteristics such as field, ring type, end type, and others). By specifying an output name, after running the buffer command, a new layer will be automatically uploaded into the DAaaS GEO Portal containg the new feature you just created. buffer_lyr = use_proximity . create_buffers ( item1 , distances = [ 1 ], units = \"Kilometers\" , output_name = 'item1_buffer' ) display ( item1_buffer ) Update Items By getting the item as we did similar to the example above, we can use the '.update' function to update exisiting item within the DAaaS GEO Portal. We can update item properties, data, thumbnails, and metadata. item1_buffer = gis . content . get ( 'c60c7e57bdb846dnbd7c8226c80414d2' ) item1_buffer . update ( item_properties = { 'title' : 'Enter Title' 'tags' : 'tag1, tag2, tag3, tag4' , 'description' : 'Enter description of item' } Visualize Your Data on an Interactive Map ipyleaflet Library In this example we will use the library 'ipyleaflet' to create an interactive map. This map will be centered around Tornoto, ON. The data being used will be outlined below. Begin by pasting conda install -c conda-forge ipyleaflet allowing you to install ipyleaflet libraries in the Python environment. Import the necessary libraries. import ipyleaflet from ipyleaflet import * import json import os Now that we have imported the aipyleaflet module, we can create a simple map by specifying the latitude and longitude of the location we want, zoom level, and basemap (more basemaps) . Extra controls have been added such as layers and scale. toronto_map = Map ( center = [ 43.69 , - 79.35 ], zoom = 11 , basemap = basemaps . Esri . WorldStreetMap ) toronto_map . add_control ( LayersControl ( position = 'topright' )) toronto_map . add_control ( ScaleControl ( position = 'bottomleft' )) toronto_map Getting the Data from the Portal It is important to note that this mapping widget does not interact with the DAaaS Geospatial Portal directly. We will have to export our layers that we created into something the ipyleaflet widget will understand. To do this we will export into a GeoJSON data type. First, we have to export the item as 'GeoJson' then download the item from the portal and specify a new folder we want to add the item to. item_export = item1_buffer . export ( 'item1_buffer_JSON' , export_format = 'GeoJson' , tags = 'tag1, tag2, tag3' ) item_download = item_export . download ( \"item1_JSON\" ) Next, add the layer to the ipyleaflet interactive map. with open ( 'item1_JSON/item1_buffer_JSON.geojson' ) as f : data1 = json . load ( f ) item1_buffer_lyr = GeoJSON ( data = data , style = { 'opacity' : 1 , 'color' : '#0000FF' , # Hex Code 'fillColor' : 'red' , # Text 'fillOpacity' : 0.2 , 'weight' : 1 }, hover_style = { 'color' : 'white' , 'fillOpacity' : 0.5 } ) toronto_map . add_layer ( item1_buffer_lyr ) By clicking run on the code, the layer is automatically updated on the interactive map above and there is no need to create a seprate map. leafmap Library The leafmap library is similair to the ipyleaflet library as seen above in a way that it lets you visualize data on an interactive map. It also comes with a suite of tools that allow you to change basemaps, upload data, perfrom analysis, and many other functions. Begin by pasting conda install leafmap -c conda-forge allowing you to install leafmap libraries in the Python environment. Import the leafmap library. import leafmap Set up an initial map. toronto_map2 = leafmap . Map ( center = [ 43.69 , - 79.35 ], zoom = 11 ) toronto_map2 Again, we will need to use GeoJSON data. We are not performing any analysis here as it was already performed. We are simply calling on the GeoJSON data by specifying its path in the Jupyter Notebook. We also have a function that will assing each polygon with a random color (in our case, either red or blue). data2 = 'item1_JSON/item1_buffer_JSON.geojson' hover_style = { 'color' : 'white' , 'fillColor' : 'red' , 'fillOpacity' : 0.5 } import random def random_color ( feature ): return { 'color' : 'black' , 'fillColor' : random . choice ([ 'red' , 'blue' ]), } toronto_map2 . add_geojson ( data2 , layer_name = data2_name , style_callback = random_color , hover_style = hover_style ) leafmap Libarary with Kepler Extension This will provide the user with many more customization options while needing the least amount of code compared the other mapping widgets demosntrated above. Begin by pasting pip install keplergl allowing you to install the extension to the leafmap widget in the Python environment. Import the leafmap library and extension along with the geopandas library. import leafmap.kepler as leafmap import geopandas as gpd Set up and import data to the interactive map. toronto_map3 = leafmap . Map ( center = [ 43.69 , - 79.35 ], zoom = 10 ) gdf = gpd . read_file ( \"item1_JSON/item1_buffer_JSON.geojson\" ) toronto_map . add_gdf ( gdf , layer_name = 'Police Buffer' ) toronto_map","title":"AAW"},{"location":"aaw/#what-is-aaw","text":"The Advanced Analytics Workspace (AAW) provides emerging state-of-the-art open source analytics and artificial intelligence tools, and compute capacity for modern data science workloads.","title":"What is AAW"},{"location":"aaw/#getting-started-in-aaw","text":"Using Jupyter Notebooks in AAW allows users to connect to the ArcGIS Enterprise Portal using various python APIs.

The DAaaS Geospatial Platform utalizes the following standards: ISO 19115-2003 HNAP , GeoDCAT-ap, SDMX. Standards facilitate the creation, sharing, and general use of geospatial data.
